# 7Geese

7Geese combines a powerful OKRs goal-tracking platform with peer recognition, coaching, and continuous feedback to improve performance across your organization.

## Overview

 *  7Geese is an app which people can read about 7Geese company (About page), see all the 7Geese repositories on github (Discover page), and search the exact 7Geese github name on Search page.


 *  The app is a React web application created with React.js, and some Bootstrap techniques. 
 
       * Used React to manage the frontend.
       * Used AXIOS for the Github API request.
       * Used four different routes for the three pages (About, Discover, and Search).
       * Used various components to make it more reusable.
       * Used links to connect every github repository on the discover page to it's corresponding page
       * Used replace and sort methods for sorting descending and removing the hyphens
       * Used gitignore to avoid commitiing node modules and etc to github.
    
## Instructions
### App Setup
1.	Make sure you start with npm install to have all the required packages through package.json file.
2.	Once step one is completed, you can continue with npm start to start the react app.
      
### DB Setup
1.	No backend or DBs were used to create this app. The app will save the retrieved information aqcuired through the API call in a variable in the frontend.

### Config Setup
1.	We didn't have any environmental variables (e.g. API Keys) to be protected so there was no need to use packages similar to dotenv which works on Node/Express backend.

### Model setup
1.	As already described in DB setup section, the app is not using any backend setup on MVC platform, so there was no need to define our model or how it connects to our DB.
 
**Note:** There were many more features that could be implemented, like having tables and show the results in them and then re-use that table component for the search page again, or writing tests for edge cases (e.g. if the user search not the exact name of a repository). Unfortunately as I am approaching the end of my program at UoT and working at the same time, I had limited opportunity to work on this task. Hope you find my endeavour satisfactory.Thank you.
